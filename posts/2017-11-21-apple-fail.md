    4 times apple made a bad design call

  <h4 class="graf graf--h4">
    How they got away with it and what to learn from it.
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    Apple computers is notirous for its unique approach to product design. attributed with &#8220;steve jobs legacey***&#8221;, the closed circute??? method means +++<br /> PR and brand is so big with apple, that in many cases people are confuesd when the company announce a mix of already avalible technologies to form a innovative (or at least precives as innovitve) products. the fact that apples products are sold more than any other means that there&#8217;s some business sense in that.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The main principle for this is the same that drives innovation, designing your own logic instead of the existing state. sometimes that works. problem is <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/2352/apple-is-really-bad-at-design">no logic makes bad design</a><br /> They continualsy brake not just convetions , but their own rules. and often make a mess when certin design choices annoy new or old users. this approach (derived from successfull innovations like ipod&#8217;s controls) leans on the beleaf that innovation or (Im gonna use that word) distruption &#8211; means disregurding basic (human centered) convetions. Reguardless of what you think or <i>feel</i> I think there&#8217;s something to be learned here.

    The iPhone on screen keyboard

  <h4>
    con:Stop calling my fingers fat
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    the apple we know today, as the #1 brand in the world, ows most of its impression to the first i-phone. As always with Apple, (like any other company) Many of it has to do with the PR and branding that&#8217;s injected to the actual product design.<br /> the first i-phone (like the mac, and i-pod before it&#8230;)was important not just as a consumer product, but as an <b>idea.</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Apple&#8217;s Halo effect didnt skip the original iphone, which included some design sins of its own. The biggest, in my oppinion is apple&#8217;s keyboard.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    this is still a big problem and today <a href="https://priceonomics.com/the-tiny-keyboard-problem-do-people-complete-forms/">people avoid using their phones to type</a> just as well. but today we know that the iphone small-size demands a motoric skill that most people shouldnt be expected to learn. this was so tricky that apple actually called our fingers &#8220;fat&#8221;, and tried to pop-out which character we&#8217;re tapping <b>while we type</b>.

    How they got away with it: wow its a touchscreen!
  </h4>
  
  <p class="graf graf--p">
    Well, this is all easy to say nowdays, back then the main competitor was blackberry, which had an easier keyboard because it was physicly tangble, but comparing both screens-sizes makes you appreaciate the iphone&#8217;s experiance more. I mean you can finally read that email! Apple also benfited the grace of the iphone actually being the first real smartphone so a faw pains (like back arrows navigation or) klunky keyboard was something most people would stomach.

    Onboarding new users

  <p class="graf graf--p">
    One of the mosty important experiances in getting a new Mac computer(comparing to PC&#8217;s) was the idea of getting an up-to date no-setup-required, ready-to use computer. no download no nothing. In order to better UX(and legal issues), apple had to verify and personalize the experiance for the iphone. that&#8217;s where things got a bit, tyiring.<br /> if you try to onboard a brand new iphone to a person that doesnt know what to do, odds are He&#8217;ll go insane. the onboarding includes Many <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.lifewire.com/set-up-new-iphone-2000125" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.lifewire.com/set-up-new-iphone-2000125">many</a> stages
  </p>

    Not to mention the obvious Terms and agreement we all read from begining to end. you also define apple id security questions, credit cards, name of your first neighbor.

    How they got away with it: service

  <p>
    Im guessing customer support and first time users buying at the istore get help with this part cus i dont really know ***
  </p>
  
  <p class="graf graf--p">
    another important point is the added values of the iCloud means less passwords
  </p>

    today apple also have an app for smoothly &#8220;moving to mac&#8221;.

  <h4>
    Con: its a dead mouse
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    <P>
      Apple&#8217;s magic mouse is a wireless blutooth mouse. The mouse users were surprised to find out that charging the mouse demanded flipping the mouse &#8220;on its back&#8221; making it useless, while you charge.<br /> this is a case of poorely designed product, that resaults in poor UX.<br /> While were at it, It&#8217;s a good time to note the mouse is totally symmetrical, which isnt just bad argonomicly, but create a problem of &#8220;loosing your north&#8221; while using it.<br /> after &#8220;outrage&#8221;- apple responded by explaining it charges fast.

      How they got away with it: magical experience!
    </h4>
    
    <p class="graf graf--p">
      For me, its one of the best onboarding experiances I&#8217;ve seen. Unlike other painful processes of connecting devices the simple Bluetooth auto connection makes a pairing without the pain. the on-screen feedback is a really important affirmation(???).

      The “touch-bar”

      provided a contextual menu, but failed when placed as a keyboard. As keyboard users (all of us) know the first rule of keyboard -is dont look at the keyboard. our brain automates and learns the location of actions so messing with different components is like not having a standard for keyboard keys… (another thing apple messed with by the way, with the whole Cmd thing..)
    </p>
    
    <p>
      another decsetion is to place the bar in expense of the Function (F1,F2 etc) keys. that means even if your open to learning new shortcuts you have to forfit the ones your used to. that all sound like making user experiane worse for the user.

      las vegas and casino&#8217;s have something in common with apple&#8217;s touchbar ==============<br /> another issue is apple made sure some cases are developed in order to sell the idea of usefullness

      I havent really had the time to go through all of the reactions the iphone X&#8217;s gotten this past weeks.<br /> Basicly apple wanted to make a fullspan touchscreen

      my initial reception of this is *** gut feeling that its a good case of product branding that will distinguish the iphone-x (they had little choice after google&#8217;s pixel looking so similar to an iphone)
